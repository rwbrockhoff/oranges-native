# Oranges to Oranges

Oranges to Oranges is a clone of the card game Apples to Apples. While the game is almost identical, the "judge" is hidden from all other game players (except the judge). That way, if the game players decide to, they can be secretive about who is the current judge. 


## Technology
Oranges to Oranges focuses on using socket.io to make an interactive game experience. We hosted our static frontend using Firebase, while hosting an external server on Digital Ocean. You can visit the repo linked towards the bottom to see our web app version, which is currently more functional than our Native integration.

### Team

This was a two week project with 4 members with 1 team lead. Merge requests were approved by the team lead. Daily standups and "team walkthroughs" helped keep the team communicating and on task. The team pair programmed on a daily basis to avoid bugs, educate each other on socket.io, and push each other to communicate our logic effectively.
